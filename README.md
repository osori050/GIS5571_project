In 2010, an explosion occurred in the Deepwater Horizon semi-submersible mobile offshore drilling unit leading to an oil spill of roughly 210 million gallons into the Gulf of Mexico. To assess the impact of said catastrophe, an ETL pipeline is built to analyze trends of dissolved oxygen, oxygen saturation, and conductivity over that area in 2010. Inverse distance weighting (IDW), global polynomial interpolation (GPI), local polynomial interpolation (LPI), and radial basis function (RBF) are used to model these water variables across the area of interest.
